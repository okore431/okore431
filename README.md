###### Hello! I'm OlgaðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub Page!

As a Full-Stack Developer, I'm all about creating websites and apps that are easy to use and look great on any device. I use different programming languages and tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Python, Axios, and SQL to make sure that everything I build is responsive and user-friendly. My goal is to create websites and apps that are both functional and appealing, so that everyone who uses them has a great experience.

About me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on interactive web application that allows users to enter their own preferences and get personalized relocation scores for different locations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m planning to learn Java.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'm happy to help. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm taco-obsessed! Tacos are my jam, my go-to, my everything.
